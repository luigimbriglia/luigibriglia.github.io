        description: |
          We pose a new rationale for precautionary savings based on type one extreme value preference shocks. In this framework, the errors of the Euler equation that predicts consumption based on observables have the same properties as the data: the log errors are an affine-increasing function of cash in hand. This is not the case with the more standard shocks to the marginal utility of consumption. We characterize the solution to the householdsâ€™ problem showing how the familiar formulas from static and discrete settings adapt to dynamic and continuous environments. We also show how the existence of these shocks provides utility-enhancing consumption opportunities that justify additional savings beyond those generated by environments with shocks to earnings, something that does not happen with standard shocks to marginal utility. The properties of the Euler equation errors allow us to estimate jointly risk aversion and the variance of the preference shocks.

  #         During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

  #         I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
